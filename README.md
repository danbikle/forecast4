# Deployment [ Laptop ]

I deployed this repo to my laptop with the steps listed below:

* I installed Virtualbox software which I downloaded from this URL:
* https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
* I downloaded and imported an Ubuntu 16 appliance [ub16_2018_0206.ova]: 
* https://drive.google.com/file/d/10p1W7kqzxE69jODhUzcb-qi-osN4htO-
* After import I logged into the ann account on the appliance with passwd: "a"
* I used a shell command to create an account named forecast4:
```
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G sudo forecast4
sudo passwd forecast4
```
* I logged out of the ann account.
* I logged into the forecast4 account.
