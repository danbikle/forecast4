~/forecast4/public/csv_readme.txt

I placed two folders here for CSV files:

csv1 is mostly for development.
It should hold CSV files which I want to commit to the git-repo.

csv2 is mostly for production.
It should hold CSV files which are large and change frequently.
These files should not be committed to the git-repo.
